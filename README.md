# Game of Space Invaders 

### Game created in Python with Pygame Library

Simple game created with few linees of code. It's a quick start for using pygame library.

Requirements:
pygame --> pip install pygame

In case of pygame not showing images, not giving any error, the problem could be related to the specific version of python.
So please install python version 3.6.5 to avoid this issue.
